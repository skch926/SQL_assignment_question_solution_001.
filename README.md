##  Overview
This project contains solutions to **50 SQL practice questions**, designed to strengthen concepts of **Data Definition Language (DDL)**, **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**, and **advanced SQL topics** such as joins, subqueries, and views.

All queries were written and tested in **MySQL Workbench** using a sample database named **`assignment`**.
